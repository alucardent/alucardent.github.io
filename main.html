                <h2 class="intro-header">Introduction</h2>
                <p class="intro-para">Born in the philippines but spent half of my life studying and living in singapore. I studied in 
                    Singapore Polytechnic (SP) for my Electrical and Elcetroninc Engineering Diploma. Here i was introduce to programming.
                    I was intruigue in my web development module and try to learn more about it but the interest fades when i have to do my FYP. 
                    After graduating, i was not sure on where to go so i followed my dad's footsteps and take on Civil Engineering in Singapore Institute of Engineering (SIT).
                    During my internship in the field of Civil Engineering, i realise that Civil Engineering may not be for me. One of my 
                    colleague reminded me of programming and how much i liked web development. From then on i tried learning web development through 
                    online courses at CodeAcademy or through various medias online such as YouTube. After Learning much more than what i learned
                    in SP, i realise that this is the path i want to take. My Goal now is to be better in this field and to change my career and
                    hope that i land a job to do something i love to do.
